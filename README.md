# Gas_Transfer
Optimization of the physics-based model of the bubble-mediated gas transfer (Kb) by Deike and Melville (2018; GRL).

Matlab scripts are available for computations of Kb(Hs, Va, T), where Hs is the signficant wave height, Va is volume of entrained air by breaking, and T is the temperature.

The details of the model are described in a paper by Shin Y., Deike L., and Romero L., "Modulation of Bubble-Mediated CO2 Gas Transfer due to Wave-Current Interactions". Submitted to Geophysical Research Letters.
