# Gas_Transfer
Optimization of the physics-based model of the bubble-mediated gas transfer (Kb) by Deike and Melville (2018; GRL).

Matlab scripts are available for computations of Kb(Hs, Va, S, T), where Hs is the signficant wave height, Va is volume of entrained air by breaking, S is the surface salinity, and T is the surface temperature.

The details of the model are described in a paper by Shin et al. (in preparation)
